# School District Analysis

## Overview
This project involves analyzing school district data to gain insights into the performance of different schools across the district. By cleaning and processing the data, we aim to provide key metrics and visualizations to help stakeholders make informed decisions about resource allocation and improvement strategies.

## Purpose
The main objective of this project is to:
- Clean and merge datasets containing student and school information.
- Calculate important metrics like average grades, budget allocation, and performance ratings.
- Create visualizations that depict overall school performance based on various factors.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: for data analysis and scripting.
- **Pandas**: for data manipulation and cleaning.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: for an interactive coding environment.
- **Matplotlib**: for data visualization.

## Data Sources
The analysis uses data from:
- `students_complete.csv`: Contains information about student names, grades, and scores.
- `schools_complete.csv`: Contains details about schools, their budgets, and student populations.

## Key Steps
1. **Data Cleaning**: Address missing data and inconsistencies to ensure accurate analysis.
2. **Data Merging**: Combine information from multiple datasets into a unified structure.
3. **Calculation of Metrics**: Extract relevant metrics such as average math and reading scores, and passing rates.
4. **Visualization**: Create graphs to visually represent findings for easy interpretation.

## Results
- **School Performance**: Identified high-performing and low-performing schools based on average scores.
- **Budget Analysis**: Showed how budget allocation correlates with school performance.
- **Student Grade Trends**: Highlighted trends in student performance across different grades and subjects.

## Conclusion
This project offers insights that can be used to make strategic decisions regarding budget distribution, resource allocation, and policy adjustments to improve overall school performance within the district.
